A first google apps script to get CoinMarketCap API data into Google Sheets.
It is a very simple and straightforward script to start with.

To get it working :
1. get a coinmarketcap api key and put it in the B1 cell of your sheet.
2. create a new google sheet, select Extensions > Apps Script. Delete existing code & replace with this one.
3. File -> Save.
4. You'll need to authorize the script to access your google account ( a pop up should appear ).
